    Given build json for Managing org "<name>" and "<particpantId>" and "<contactPerson>" and "<contactEmail>" and "<contactPhone>" and "<address1>" and "<address2>" and "<city>" and "<state>" and "<zip>"
    When create org with this data
    Then verification of Actual vs expected results <expStatusCode> and "<responseMsg>"
    When Get by id <id> and <type>

    Examples:
