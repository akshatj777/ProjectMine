  Scenario Outline: Create User through UA API call
    Given Build JSON for Create User "<FirstName>" and "<LastName>" and "<Email>" and "<Phone>" and "<NPI>" and "<RoleID>" and "<Applications>" and "<Locations>" and "<LearningPathways>"
    When Create User with this data for "<User>"
    Then Verify Actual vs expected results "<expStatusCode>" and "<responseMsg>"
    Given I am on mail login page
    Then I enter username "qaautomation@remedypartners.com" to login mail account
    Then I enter password "1Welcome2" to login mail account
    Then I click on Mail icon in my account
    Then I click on Inbox in mail
    And I wait for 3000 milli seconds
    Then I verify account for user "<User>-<Role>"
    Then I set new password for the user "<User>-<Role>"
