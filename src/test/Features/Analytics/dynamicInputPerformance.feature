  Scenario: Execute JMX file and read Output data for Data Metrics Validation for - CLAIMS
    When I close the file for after writting data to input file
    Given I clear output data for Data metrics from "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\PerformanceDashboard\\dynamicPerformanceDashboardResult.txt" Output file
    When I execute the jmeter application and execute jmx file "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\PerformanceDashboard\\TableauTestDynamic.jmx"
    Then I read the values from the text file "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\PerformanceDashboard\\dynamicPerformanceDashboardResult.txt"

  Scenario Outline: Verify DB and FE values feteched from Scenarios(1&2) - Claims (For Metrics Validations & Benchmark Tool Tip)
    And I get the value "<Index>" from Output file of data metric validation
    Then I verify "KPI_Episode" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "Savings Rate" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "KPI_Program_size" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "KPI_NPRA" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "% SNF Disch Current" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "SNF Days Current" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "Readmissions Current" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "% SNF Disch Benchmark Variance" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "SNF Days Benchmark Variance" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"
    Then I verify "Readmissions Benchmark Variance" for DB and FE Metrics value at "<Row>" for "Claims"

    Examples: 
      | Index | Row |
      |     0 |   1 |
      |     1 |   2 |
      |     2 |   3 |
