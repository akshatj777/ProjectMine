  Scenario: Execute JMX file and read Output data for Data Filter Validations for EC
    When I close the file for after writing data to input file
    Given I clear output data for Data metrics from "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\CARLDashboard\\RowFilterOutput.txt" Output file
    When I execute the jmeter application and execute jmx file "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\CARLDashboard\\RowFilter.jmx"
    Then I read the values from the text file "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\CARLDashboard\\RowFilterOutput.txt"

  @RowLevelSecurity @CARL
  Scenario Outline: Verify DB and FE values fetched from EC Scenarios
    And I get the value "<Index>" from Output file of data filter validation
    Then I verify "Episode Initiator - BPID" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Anchor Facility - CCN" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Bundle" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Region - Market" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Remedy Region - Market" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Participant" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "DRG" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Physician - NPI" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"
    Then I verify "Model" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC"

    Examples: 
      | Index | Row |
      |     0 |   1 |
      |     1 |   2 |
      |     2 |   3 |
