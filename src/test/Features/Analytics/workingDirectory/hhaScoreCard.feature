  Scenario: Execute JMX file and read Output data for Data Filter Validations
    When I close the file for after writing data to input file
    Given I clear output data for Data metrics from "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\HHAScoreCard\\RowFilterOutput.txt" Output file
    When I execute the jmeter application and execute jmx file "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\HHAScoreCard\\RowFilter.jmx"
    Then I read the values from the text file "\\src\\test\\Jmeter\\HHAScoreCard\\RowFilterOutput.txt"

  @HHAScorecardRLS @HHA
  Scenario Outline: Verify DB and FE values fetched from Scenarios
    And I get the value "<Index>" from Output file of data filter validation
    Then I verify "Post Acute Facility - CCN" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"
    Then I verify "Bundle" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"
    Then I verify "Region - Market" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"
    Then I verify "Remedy Region - Market" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"
    Then I verify "Participant" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"
    Then I verify "Episode Initiator - BPID" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"
    Then I verify "Anchor Facility - CCN" for DB and FE filter values at "<Row>" for "EC & Claims"

    Examples: 
      | Index | Row |
      |     0 |   1 |
      |     1 |   2 |
      |     2 |   3 |
      |     3 |   4 |
      |     4 |   5 |
      |     5 |   6 |
      |     6 |   7 |
      |     7 |   8 |
      |     8 |   9 |
      |     9 |  10 |
      |    10 |  11 |
      |    11 |  12 |
      |    12 |  13 |
